    <h1>Let's get to know each other</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Katie Marple and I'm a bilingual British model living in
      Osaka. I have traveled to over thirty countries, and lived in five. I love
      playing with different photography styles to achieve the perfect shot.
      <br />
      <br />My method of work is straight forward, I create or discuss a
      concept, then set a mood board and research the best place to achieve our
      desired look. I've worked with many photographers across the world. So, if
      your interested in working with me to create beauitful shots, please get
      in touch. You can also view my gallery to see my art, all created with
      love.
